# mean2me
A cross-platform app to break down big numbers (like 40 billions) in a meaningful number for the user.
The aim is to self enable people to develop a better understanding of these big numbers that we always read of in the newspapers.

Two questions will be answered by this app:
1. What else is about this big number? Is it the cost of an airplane-carrier? Or the GDP of SriLanka?
2. What does this mean to me (mean2me) as I am maybe an American citizen? So let's divide this number by the number of citizens, or the number of taxpayers, or the number of car drivers, ...

This is the repository for developing the code for this app (or a webbased app) using the bigNumbers dataset, that's developed in another repository. (see: https://github.com/Palmstroemen/bigNumbers )

First challenges: 
1. Decide for a licence
2. Decide for a SDK and framework.
3. Develop the simple code.
